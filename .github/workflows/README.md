# .github/workflows/

This folder will store the **GitHub Actions workflows** for the
`qa-automation-playwright-template` project.

Planned workflows:

- CI pipeline to install dependencies and run Playwright tests in headless mode
- Optional jobs to publish Playwright HTML reports and traces as build artifacts
- Future templates for scheduled or environment-specific test runs

> 🚀 Status: placeholder – workflows will be added once the Playwright template is ready.
