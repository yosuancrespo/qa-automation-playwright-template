# fixtures/

This folder will contain **test data** used by the Playwright E2E tests in the
`qa-automation-playwright-template` project.

Planned usage:

- JSON files with users, credentials and test scenarios
- Reusable data sets for different environments (dev, staging, production-like)
- Any other structured data needed to keep tests clean and maintainable

> 🔧 Status: placeholder – actual fixtures will be added as the template evolves.
